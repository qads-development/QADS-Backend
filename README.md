# QADS.cloud Rust Back-end
Although our account system is based on Firestore, Suite and Dashboard use the Rust Back-end to store data. However, we are currently working on moving accounts to a Rust backend.

QADS.cloud is not a company and does not hold any copyrights, so you are free to use this code as you see fit. We appreciate attribution.

We do not share the code that we develop for companies, and it's their own choice if they want to publish it online. This is not the back-end for any of our users.
